- **Tasks:** hs-community-fridge (harness 1.2.0, commit `6adf156`)
- **Date:** 2026-10-30T11:35:50.930Z
- **Trials per model per task:** 1
- **Human review:** _pending_

> Cost and token figures are **estimates** (chars ÷ 4 × list prices) — directional, not billing-grade.
> Mechanical columns are medians across trials. Total = plan + build wall time.
> **Bundle** = final compile success; **First try** = compiled without the auto-fix; **Renders** = opened in a browser after bundling, visible page and no uncaught errors (n/a before Oct 30, 2026); **Fail kind** = what the first-try bundle error was (missing-file, bad-import, unknown-package, syntax); **Lint/100** = eslint findings per 100 lines with the app's own config; **Largest file**, **any**, **Kit files** (files importing the RB kit over code files) and **tok/s** come from the files the model wrote (n/a before Oct 31, 2026); **Fix time** = the auto-fix pass's own wall time; **Fix** = of the builds that first failed, how many the single auto-fix pass solved. **~$** includes the fix pass when one ran.
